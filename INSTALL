Linux Installation
Linux package should work with most Linux distributions that use systemd. Currently x64 (x86_64) and ARM versions of the installer are available.

If you are using Ubuntu, check the Installation on DigitalOcean guide for more detailed installation instructions and a video.

Install
Download and extract the installer package
Execute traccar.run file
sudo ./traccar.run
Start systemd service
sudo systemctl start traccar
Uninstall

sudo systemctl stop traccar
Remove systemd service
sudo systemctl disable traccar
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/traccar.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

By default Traccar is executed with root user privileges. If you want to run it as a regular user, check run as non-root documentation.
